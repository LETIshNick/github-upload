# Simple Guided Optics
A small collection of several classical methods for guided optics.

The package contains the following features:
The calculatiion of propagation constant, effective index, group velocity, GDD, D2 on frequency;
Frequency dependent materials are supported as well as constant ones;

Planar geometry is resolved analytically (Pollock Lipson)
Slab geometry is resolved with the famework of a modified Marcatili method (Menon, 2002), while Goell's method is also supported;

Future:
Coupled wave solutions for waveguide Bragg gratings: planar, slab, TE/TM modes of a propagating and a radiation type.
Several primitive devices as rings (add-drop, all pass) modulators;
Pulse propagation in linear media.
